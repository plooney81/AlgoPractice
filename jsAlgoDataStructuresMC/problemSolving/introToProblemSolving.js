//! Problem Solving steps
//* 1. Understand the problem
//* 2. Explore concrete examples
//* 3. Break it down
//* 4. Solve and Simplify
//* 5. Look back and refactor

//* Understanding the problem
//? When you get a new question you should:
//? 1. restate the problem in your own words
//? 2. explain what the inputs and outputs of the problem are?
//? 3. determine if the outputs can be determined from the inputs
//? 4. determine how the important pieces of data should be labeled for the problem

//todo EXAMPLE for Understanding the problem:
// Function that takes two #'s and returns their sum:
// 1. Add two numbers together
// 2. Ints, floats, string for large # ?
// 3. Depends
// 4. Function name (something like --> returnSum), num1, num2
