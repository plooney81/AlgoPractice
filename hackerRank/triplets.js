//! Another triplet problem like above ^^
//? You are given an array and you need to find number of triplets of indices(i,j,k) such that the elements at those indices are in 
//? geometric progression for a given common ratio r and i<j<k. HackerRank link here --> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/count-triplets-1/problem?h_r=internal-search
//TODO Example: arr = [1,4,16,64] r = 4
//TODO answer: --> 2 ([1, 4, 16] and [4, 16, 64]) 

const countTriplets = (arr, r) => {
    // First we reorder the elements in the array in ascending order, this will help us with the i<j<k condition
    // arr.sort((a, b) => a - b) //! This actually isn't right, they don't want to you to reorder, keep it in original order.

    // Initialize a right hash table and a left hash table, because we will starting at index 0, all numbers will be in the right hash map and no numbers will be in the left hash map
    const leftHash = {};
    const rightHash = {};
    arr.forEach(numb => {
        leftHash[numb] = 0;

    })

    //Initialize our counter variable
    let count = 0;
    arr.forEach(numb => {
        // We first need to subtract one from the count of the current number in the right hash table
        rightHash[numb] -= 1;
        // Then we find how many values to the left that satisfy itself/r and how many values to the right that satisfy itself * r
        let leftCount = leftHash[numb/r] ? leftHash[numb/r] : 0;
        let rightCount  = rightHash[numb*r] ? rightHash[numb*r] : 0;

        count += rightCount*leftCount;
