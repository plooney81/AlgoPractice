## **General**
- This repository houses coding challenges and learning material for different algorithms and data structures I have learned.
- If you are interested in learning more about some of this material, I have included some snippets as well as some notes to help explain some of the code you will find in the repo.

**Quick Note about these Examples:**
- If you are downloading the examples, I would highly suggest downloading the [better comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) vscode extension. It will make the example questions far easier to read, and you might even start to notice a pattern in the way I write the comments.

Enjoy!!

## **Algorithms**
- Algorithms are a process or set of steps to solve a problem or accomplish a specific task.
- Algorithms are the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer.
- Almost everything we do as programmers involves some sort of problem solving.
### **Problem Solving**
#### **Steps**:
    1. Understand the problem
    2. Explore concrete examples
    3. Break down the problem into steps
    4. Solve the problem (or attempt to)
    5. Look at your solution...try and refactor

#### **Patterns**:
 - Frequency Counters:
   - Uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of those values
   - Ex: [frequencyCounter.js](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/problemSolvingPatterns/frequencyCounters.js)
 - Multiple Pointers:
   - Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the begginning, middle, or end...depending on a condition.
   - Ex: [multiplePointers.js](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/problemSolvingPatterns/multiplePointers.js)
 - Sliding Window:
   - Creates a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
   - Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes and new window is created.
   - Ex: [slidingWindowPatter.js](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/problemSolvingPatterns/slidingWindowPatter.js)
 - Divide and Conquer:
   - Involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and repeating a process with a subset of the data.
   - Ex: [binarySearch](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/searchAlgorithms/binarySearch.js)

   - Multiple Pointers: 
     - [averagePair](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/problemSolvingPatterns/optionalChallenges/mp_averagePair.js)
     - [duplicates](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/problemSolvingPatterns/optionalChallenges/mp_duplicates.js)
     - [isSusequence](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/problemSolvingPatterns/optionalChallenges/mp_isSubsequence.js)
   - Sliding Window:
     - [findLongestSubstring](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/problemSolvingPatterns/optionalChallenges/sw_findLongestSubstring.js)
     - [maxSubarraySum](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/problemSolvingPatterns/optionalChallenges/sw_maxSubarraySum.js)
     - [minSubArrayLen](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/problemSolvingPatterns/optionalChallenges/sw_minSubArrayLen.js)
   - Divide and Conquer:
     - [quickSort](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/sortAlgorithms/IntermediateSortingAlgorithms/QuickSort/quickSort.js)
     - [mergeSort](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/sortAlgorithms/IntermediateSortingAlgorithms/MergeSort/mergeSort.js)

### **Recursion**
#### **Basics**
- Recursion is simply a function or method that calls itself
- Two things need to be present in a recursive function:
    1. A base case --> Condition when the recursion ends
    2. Invoking the fuction with different input.
- Common recursion pitfalls:
  - NO BASE CASE!!
  - Forgetting to return something...or returning the wrong thing
  - Stack overflow

#### **Different Types Of Recursive Functions**
- Helper method Recursion:
    - Utilizes a helper method to handle the recursion piece of the function instead of the whole function being recursive.
    - A little more straightforward and easier to read.
- Pure Recursion
  -  Simply returns and concats...i.e. the whole function is recursive.
  -  Some helpful tips:
     -  Arrays ==> Use methods like slice, spread operator, and concat that make copies of arrays
     -  String ==> use methods like slice, substr, or substring
     -  Objects ==> use object.assign or the spread operator
  - Not as straightforward as above, but are a fun challenge and much shorter!
- A good example highlighting the difference between these two can be found [here](https://github.com/plooney81/AlgoPractice/blob/master/jsAlgoDataStructuresMC/recursion/helperMethodVsPureRecursion.js)
